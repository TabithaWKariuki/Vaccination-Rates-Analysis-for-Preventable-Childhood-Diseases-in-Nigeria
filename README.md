# Vaccination-Rates-Analysis-for-Preventable-Childhood-Diseases-in-Nigeria
The objective of this data science project is to analyze and derive insights from the vaccination rates of children aged 12-23 months against preventable childhood diseases
in Nigeria. The dataset, sourced from the National Bureau of Statistics in 2018, is available through an API. The project aims to create client value by providing data-driven insights
and recommendations for improving vaccination rates through data analysis and providing actionable recommendations. 
## Research Problem
The dataset can be found using this [link](https://africaopendata.org/dataset/vaccination_coverage_2018/resource/e2bcc139-4c7a-4096-945b-912a0f8b5385): dataset and should be accessed through the provided API. It contains the necessary information, including state, vaccine, total, and ID. Additional assumptions may be made if required to complete the analysis effectively. I will use this [additional population dataset](https://nigeria.opendataforafrica.org/crhsjdg/population-of-nigeria-2016) if needed as part of your analysis as well as other relevant datasets that could enhance your analysis.
In order to work on the above problem, you need to do the following:
* Define the question, the metric for success, the context, experimental design taken and the appropriateness of the available data to answer the given question
* Find and deal with outliers, anomalies, and missing data within the dataset.
* Perform univariate and bivariate analysis recording your observations.
* Perform/Fit model and check their accuracy level.
* Challenge your solution by providing insights on how you can make improvements.
